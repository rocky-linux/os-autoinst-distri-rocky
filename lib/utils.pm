    # of 2020-05-07:

    # 1. If there's a /.buildstamp and/or /tmp/product/.buildstamp file
    # the installer environment, and/or the environment variable
    # PRODBUILDPATH is set and points to a file that exists, it reads
    # config from those file(s), in that order of precedence, and if
    # the key 'IsFinal' exists in the section 'Main', its value is
    # used as anaconda's `product.isFinal`. Installer images built by
    # lorax have this buildstamp file, and it always sets IsFinal: if
    # --isfinal was passed to lorax it is set to True, if not it is set
    # to False. Whether lorax is run with --isfinal can be specified
    # in the Pungi config, but there's also a heuristic: it usually
    # defaults to False, but if the compose has a label and it's an
    # 'RC' or 'Update' or 'SecurityFix' compose (see definition of
    # SUPPORTED_MILESTONES in productmd.composeinfo), the default is
    # True. AFAICS, Fedora's pungi configs don't explicitly set this,
    # but rely on the heuristic. So for installer images, we expect
    # isFinal to be True for RC candidate composes and post-release
    # nightly Cloud, IoT etc. composes (these are also marked as 'RC'
    # composes), but False for Rawhide and Branched nightly composes
    # and Beta candidate composes. For installer images built by our
    # own _installer_build test, we control whether --isfinal is set
    # or not; we pass it if the update is for a stable release, we do
    # not pass it if the update is for Branched. Live images do not
    # have the buildstamp file.

    # 2. If there's no buildstamp file, the value of the environment
    # variable ANACONDA_ISFINAL is used as `product.isFinal`, default
    # of False if that environment var is not set. The live installer
    # wrapper script sets ANACONDA_ISFINAL based on the release field
    # of whatever package provides system-release: if it starts with
    # "0.", it sets ANACONA_ISFINAL to "false", otherwise it sets it
    # to "true". So for live images, we expect isFinal to be True
    # unless the fedora-release-common package release starts with 0.

    # 3. If `product.isFinal` is False, the pre-release warning and
    # tags are shown; if it is False, they are not shown.

    # We don't really need to check this stuff for update tests, as
    # the only installer images we test on updates are ones we build
    # ourselves; there's no value to this check for those really.
    # For compose tests, we will expect to see the pre-release tags if
    # the compose is Rawhide, or a Beta candidate, or it's a nightly
    # and we're checking an installer image. If it's an RC or Updates
    # candidate, or a respin release, we expect NOT to see the tags.
    # If it's a nightly and we're checking a live image, we don't do
    # the check.
